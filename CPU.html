        <h2>CPU</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p class="sub_para">
        CPU is probably what confuses most people. There are so many choices to begin with, and 2 companies to choose from. There is no 
        one-size-fits-all. It really depends on what you want. Whether you want a desktop or laptop also makes a significant difference.
        <br>
        To begin with, there are 2 major companies - AMD and Intel. In most cases, AMD offers better performance while being cheaper
        than Intel. But both have their pros and cons, and you can't rule out one over the other. <br>
        <br>
        </p>

        <h4>AMD or Intel?</h4>
       
        <p class="sub_para">
        First, let's talk about desktop chips <br>
        AMD is known for more cores and performance. Anything that need multi-core performance will be better off with AMD. But check with 
        the specific software you are going to be using most just in case. <br>
        Intel, on the other hand, has higher single core performance. This is beneficial in games mainly, where you will generally get 1-5% 
        higher performance with Intel. Also since Intel has had such high market shares, some software might be optimized more for Intel. 
        In short, if you are doing any productive work, you will most probably want to go with AMD. But this is for desktops.
        The latest desktop chips from AMD are Ryzen 3000 series, while in Intel, it is Intel 10th generation. <br>
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p class="sub_para">
        Now coming to laptops. Keep in mind that AMD laptop chips are 1 generation behind.  So the latest generation in laptops is AMD 4000 series, <br>
        which is equivalent to 3000 series in desktops. 
        AMD was far behind last year, with AMD 3000 laptop chips significantly slower than Intel But this year, AMD is significantly 
        faster and more efficient. The Ryzen 7 4800 series, competition for Intel i7, outperforms the Intel i9! But the Ryzen chips are new and 
        only a handful of laptops have them. <br>
        <br>
        While in desktops, Intel and AMD were quite close, in laptops, the difference is enormous, with AMD far ahead. Though WARNING: we are 
        talking about the Ryzen 4000 series only. <br>
        <br>
        </p>

        <h4>Which processor to buy?</h4>

        <p class="sub_para">
        This is the part where most people make a mistake. 
        In Intel there are 4 categories of chips - i3, i5, i7 and i9. There is also Celeron and Atom and other useless things that you shouldn't buy
        In AMD, there are 4 too - Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 9. They are competitors to their respective intel chips with the same number. <br>
        <br>
        If you are only going to be doing basic tasks like web browsing and MS Word and what not, then an i3/Ryzen 3 is plenty of power.
        Anything above, that requires power, but not alot of it, such as light photo editing, coding, etc then go with an i5/Ryzen 5. 
        Anything that's heavier such as high resolution video editing, running virtual machines, etc, an i7/Ryzen 7 will serve you better. 
        And if you need an i9/Ryzen 9, then you will know. Its only for the heaviest tasks. <br>
        <br>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        
        <p class = "sub_para">
        If you are confused about what you need and your workload doesn't include anything heavier than photo editing, then buy an i5/Ryzen 5.
        It should be powerful enough for most tasks. If web browsing is the most you are going to do, then focus more on other hardware 
        such as getting a nice display. An i3/Ryzen 3 will be plenty.
