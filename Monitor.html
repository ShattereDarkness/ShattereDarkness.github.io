        <h2>Monitor</h2>
        <hr>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p class="sub_para">
        Unlike CPU and storage, monitors aren't that complicated, and don't have complicated keywords. The main things that
        you should look out for are screen size, resolution and color accuracy. Screen size and resolution are very straight
        forward. Color accuracy might be a bit confusing though.
        </p>

        <h4>Screen size</h4>
        <p class="sub_para">
        The first thing you must keep in mind is that a monitor's screen size is measured diagonally across the monitor. <br>
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.akshatblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/monitor-screen-size.jpg" 
          alt = "Size comparison between 24 inch and 19 inch monitors"
          style="width: 500px;" class="center"/>
          <figcaption class="caption">24" vs 19"</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="sub_para">
        In laptops, the most common screen sizes are 13", 14", 15" and 17". <br>
        13" and 14" are almost the same. These are found on smaller laptops that are light and portable. If you workload doesn't 
        involve content creation, such as photo/video editing, or anything that requires a big screen, then these laptops are going
        to be perfect. <br>
        15" or most commonly, 15.6" is the standard size of most laptops. This screen size is just perfect for almost everything.
        These laptops are not too clumsy and are a good middle ground. They're great as long as you really don't need alot of screen,
        and if you don't know if you would need a bigger screen, you probably don't. <br>
        17" laptops are quite rare, and are heavy and clumsy. They're essentially desktop replacements and are quite powerful usually.
        For heavy workloads, if building a desktop isn't an option, then this is the way to go. <br>
        <br>
        Coming to desktops, the standard size here is 23" - 24". Many older desktops use 19" monitors, and since it's a desktop,
        you will be sitting a bit further away from the screen. Plus portability isn't an issue, so 23" offers the best balance - 
        it's not too big nor too small. 27" and above is also an option, but you should only go for them if you really need that
        big of a screen. At 32" and above, it essentially breaches into TV territory. <br>
        </p>

        <h4>Resolution</h4>
        <p class="sub_para">
        Resolution is where many people fall prey to marketing terms. You may have heard of Full HD, Quad HD or 2K and 4K. Resolution basically tells 
        how many pixels your display has. The higher the resolution, the sharper the content you see looks. In case of computers, it also means that you 
        you can choose to have more content on the screen, for the same screen size.
        </p>

          <img src="https://s33046.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wordimage-132.png" 
          alt = "Comparison between resolutions"
          style="width: 500px; border: none;" class="center"/>
          <figcaption class="caption">Comparison between different resolutions</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="sub_para">
        Full HD in numbers is 1920 * 1080, also called 1080p. This means there are 1920 pixels from left to right on the monitor, and 1080 pixels top to bottom.
        This is the standard format for now, and this should be more than good enough, unless you want to do 4K photo or video 
        editing. 
        <br><br>
        2K is a good middle ground, and 4K is alot of pixels, and overkill for most people. usually monitors 27" and above go 
        well with 4K. Only go for 2K or 4K if those extra pixels serve a practical purpose for your workload. At 24" and below 
        especially, 1080p is the best choice for most.
        </p>

        <h4>Monitor type</h4>
        <p class="sub_para">
        You may have heard of many buzzwords such as IPS, OLED, etc. These are different panel technologies that have different use cases.
        <br><br>
        The most common type is an IPS panel. These are typically very good, with good colour accuracy and wide viewing angles. You can't go wrong
        with most IPS panels, and are a standard.
        <br><br>
        TN panels, on the other hand are preferred by gamers. They have fast response times and are relatively cheap. But they have bad viewing angles 
        and often, average color accuracy. 
        <br><br>
        VA panels are a niche middle ground, with better colour accuracy and contrast than TN, and better response times than IPS. However they are 
        quite rare.
        <br><br>
        Finally we come to OLED, the most expensive type of panel. These boast high colour accuracy and very high contrast ratio, and rich colours.
        They are more of a luxury than a necessity for most people, unless you could really use the perks the technology offers.

        <h4>Color accuracy/Color gamut</h4>
        <p class="sub_para">
        A monitor is limited to a spectrum of colours it can accurately display. This is what differentiates cheap and expensive
        monitors. As long as the color gamut is above average, most people won't be able to tell the difference between that and 
        something more expensive. However, for photo, video editing or anything that requires high color accuracy, a high color 
        gamut display is absolutely essential. <br>
        <br>
        I'll admit I don't know enough to help you make a buying decision, so I will include some nice resources to read about them.
